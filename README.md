# Personal NeoVim Configuration

## Features
- blink.cmp
- **NEW** LSP
> *As of nvim version 0.11.5+
- Treesitter
- Alpha.nvim
- ~~Lualine~~

## Why not use a distro?

1. No bloat 
2. Fully compatible with my things
3. New LSP Config made everything more interconnected
4. NeoVim is becoming more *Batteries-included*
5. Just a fun project for me to maintain
